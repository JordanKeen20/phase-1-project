### The Idea
   * For this application the Idea is to help youth with special needs accomplish everyday tasks at home.

## The Overview 
   A user can fill out a form to add chore/event to a list that they want a special needs youth to complete. They will be able to add an video to the chore to help explain what they are suppose to do. That can be accessed by clicking on the picture. Once the task is complete they can check it off and it will trigger and animation showing it was comleted. A user can edit or delete the chore/event as needed. A user will also be able to search through some pre-selected chores/events that have an example video and picture that is already set up.
